## About This Project
This project was built to create a web-based drawing application similar to MS Paint, but with modern features and a responsive interface. It demonstrates advanced canvas manipulation techniques and state management in React.

> **Note:** This project is still under active development with more features planned for future releases.

## Technologies Used
### Core Stack
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Main programming language
- **React.js** ‚Äì UI development library
- **Vite** ‚Äì Build tool for faster development
- **HTML5 Canvas** ‚Äì Core drawing functionality
- **CSS** ‚Äì Styling and layout

### Additional Libraries
- **Lucide** ‚Äì Icon components for the interface
- **Material UI** ‚Äì Component library for UI elements like sliders
- **LocalStorage API** ‚Äì Persistent storage of canvas data

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience with:
- Advanced React hooks including `useReducer`, `useRef`, and `useContext`
- Complex state management with reducer patterns
- DOM manipulation and low-level graphics programming
- Building transform matrices and coordinate system conversions
- Event handling and user interaction design
- Component composition and reusability strategies
- Implementing persistent storage patterns
- Creating modular, maintainable UI systems

## üêû Known Issues
- Drawing is interrupted if the user's mouse leaves the canvas area while drawing

## Future Plans
- Add export functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Implement shape selection and manipulation
- Add Layers system for organizing elements
- Improve text customization
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Add image import functionality
- Create predefined shape templates
- Implement single-user persistence (save/load functionality)
